# add2path

## What This Is
I was trying to install a program and run it from the command line, but the .exe wasn't being added to my path.\
It sounds dumb, but that was the inspiration for this project.

## How It Works
Well, it doesn't yet. But the goal is to be able to run a command like `add2path "C:/path/to/target"` and have it automatically add that directory to the Windows path.
